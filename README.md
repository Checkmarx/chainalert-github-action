### ChainAlert
A free service by Checkmarx for the community that scans popular packages and alert in cases there is suspicion those packages' accounts were hacked.

### The Need
Recent package takeover incidents such as [coa](https://checkmarx.com/blog/attackers-write-bugs-as-well/) and [ua-parser-js](https://checkmarx.com/blog/uaparser-js-attack-preparations/) have stressed the need for an alarm system to alert developers and users.

Learning the lessons of these supply chain incidents we've created **ChainAlert**, a monitoring service that will help minimize the damages from those attacks by closing the gap between takeover to detection and mitigation.

### What It Does?

ChainAlert service monitors new releases of packages and analyze:
- Newly added auto install scripts such as `install`, `preinstall`, `postinstall` scripts 
- Inconsistent package version compared the linked VCS git tags


Once ChainAlert detect one of these suspicious activities, it will open automatic GitHub issues on:
- The package's GitHub repo, to notify the maintainers of that activity
- Any package dependents' GitHub repo who's opted in


### How Do I Opt In?

Simply add the following GitHub action to your workflow, we will take it from there:
- ðŸ’¡ This service is available for public GitHub projects only

```yml

```


### Features
- NPM packages support

#### WIP 
- PyPi packages support
- Private repos support
- Automatic pull-requests
